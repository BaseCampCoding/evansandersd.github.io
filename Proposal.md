Project Name: Evan Sander's Portfolio Project

Project Desc. and Motivation - This website is a visual representation of my abilities as a programmer. It will feature information about me, my abilities, and contact information. Viewers of the site will understand me professionally as well as personally, as a bio will be included on the site. I'm creating this website to show employers I am passionate about design and programming. The sole purpose of this is to entice potential employers to hire me.

Prior Art -
I have taken inspiration from Robby Leonardi's Portfolio and John Henry Muller's Portfolio.
For the direction of my portfolio, I wanted the design to take a modern feel. A modern twist is what makes my portfolio similar to theirs. Though the differences are staggering. I don't use animation at all in my portfolio. Another difference is that typically portfolios are reflections of ones skill, and what my site reflects is a level of skill that pales in comparison to theirs.
Their site is more of an experience. My site is not. It's more barebones.

Core User Workflows -
Users should be able to see my name and contact information
Users should be able to see my bio
Users should be able to see my projects
Users should be able to see the description for each project
